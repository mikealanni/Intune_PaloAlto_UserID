# Intune_PaloAlto_UserID
After we moved from AD server to EntraID we lost USerID information, all solution was not acceptable to us from Palo Alto Team. so I start to create this script with some help with AI. it is not the best at least its a solution for now. 
Maybe add defender data to make it more accurate.

It is Python script to get inTune wiredIPv4 data from MS GRAV v2 Beta
it uses Tenet ID, Client ID and Secret Value (paasword) this can chase as you wish to use token Directly
Also you need the Palo Alto Firewall IP (userid distrbuter), sure you need to allow userID in the interface services
choose the network subnet that you need to inquiry 
Enjoy
